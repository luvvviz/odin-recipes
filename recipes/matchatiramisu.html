        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>⅓ cup sugar</li>
            <li>8 oz mascarpone cheese</li>
            <li>1½ cups heavy (whipping) cream</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all the ingredients and equipment.</li>
            <li>
                <p>In the medium heatproof mixing bowl, add the egg yolks, marsala wine, and 3 Tbsp of the granulated sugar (out of ⅓ cup total). Start whisking it with a handheld electric mixer.</p>
                <p>Continue to cook the egg mixture, beating it constantly. The egg mixture will increase in volume and becoming lighter in texture. It also will turn a pale yellow color.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, put the mascarpone in another large bowl and soften it with a silicone spatula. Add the cooled egg mixture into the bowl with the mascarpone.</li>
            <li><p>In a small bowl, combine the hot water (175ºF/80ºC) and matcha powder. Whisk together until there are no lumps. Transfer this matcha mixture to a flat-bottomed container big enough for a ladyfinger cookie to lay flat.</p></li>
        </ol>
