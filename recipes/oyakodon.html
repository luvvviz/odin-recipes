        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Oyakodon is a classic comfort food of Japanese home cooking. Tender pieces of chicken, onions, and eggs are simmered in an umami-rich sauce and then poured over a bowl of fluffy steamed rice.</p>
        <p>Simple, delicious, and utterly comforting, this is the kind of one-bowl meal you can cook in less than 30 minutes!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>½ onion</li>
            <li>10 oz boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp sake</li>
            <li>3-4 large eggs (50 g each w/o shell)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine ½ cup dashi (Japanese soup stock), 2 Tbsp soy sauce, 2 Tbsp mirin, and 2 tsp sugar in a bowl or a liquid measuring cup and mix all together until the sugar is dissolved.</li>
            <li>Turn on the heat to medium and bring it to a simmer. Once simmering, add the chicken on top of the onions.</li>
            <li>If the heat is too strong, lower the heat. If the egg is moving toward the edges of the pan, gently gather it toward the center where the heat is not as strong. Optionally, you can cover the pan if the egg whites are taking a long time to set.</li>
        </ol>
